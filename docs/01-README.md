## Project Description

MyTravel is a full-stack travel booking platform designed to provide users with a comprehensive travel planning experience. The application serves as a one-stop solution for travelers seeking to discover new destinations, book travel services, and organize their trips efficiently.

The platform enables users to browse an extensive catalog of travel destinations from around the world. Each destination includes detailed information, high-quality imagery, and transparent pricing to help travelers make informed decisions. Users can book flights, hotels, and guided tours directly through the platform, with all selections managed through an integrated shopping cart and checkout system.

A standout feature of MyTravel is the interactive trip planner, which allows users to create custom itineraries using drag-and-drop functionality. This tool empowers travelers to organize their activities day by day, visualize their journey, and adjust plans as needed before finalizing their bookings.

The platform also includes a travel blog section where users can read destination guides, travel tips, and stories from other travelers. Authenticated users have the ability to create and publish their own blog posts, contributing to the community knowledge base.

For returning users, MyTravel provides account management features including booking history, profile customization, and saved preferences. This personalization ensures a streamlined experience for frequent travelers.

The administrative side of the platform offers a comprehensive dashboard for managing the entire system. Administrators can oversee user accounts, process and track bookings, moderate blog content, and monitor platform statistics. This dual-interface approach ensures smooth operation for both end users and platform managers.
